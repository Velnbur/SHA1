# My implementation of SHA1 hash-function algorithm

## Usage

For development you may just copy header `include/sha1.h` and source `src/sha1.c` files to your project.

If you want to run tests:
```shell
make test
```

If you want to create an object file for further compiling:
```shell
make build
```

`sha1.o` will be in `build` directory.
