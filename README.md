# My realisation of SHA1 hash-function algoritm

## Usage
For developing you may just copy header `include/sha1.h` and source `src/sha1.c` files to your project.

If you want to run tests:
> make test

If you want to create object file for further compiling:
> make build

`sha1.o` will be in `build` directory.
